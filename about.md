# About PROVES Kit Agent

## Vision

Build institutional memory for CubeSat programs so teams can detect cross-system risks before integration and learn from prior missions.

---

## The Problem

- Knowledge is scattered across docs, repos, tests, and chat threads
- Hidden dependencies show up late and cause mission delays
- Student turnover erases hard-won lessons

---

## The Solution

PROVES Kit Agent is the agentic layer that powers the PROVES Library. It combines:

1. **Truth-layer curation** with human verification
2. **MCP server access** for structured queries and evidence
3. **GNN risk modeling** (Proves_AI) built on the verified graph

---

## How It Works

- LangGraph orchestrates a curator workflow with extractor, validator, and storage sub-agents
- All findings are staged, reviewed by humans, and promoted into the truth graph
- The knowledge graph uses ERV relationships with evidence and scope
- MCP provides a single query interface for IDEs, CLIs, and other agents

---

## Relationship to PROVES Library and Proves_AI

- **PROVES Library** is the canonical knowledge graph and documentation store
- **PROVES Kit Agent** is the public-facing agentic system and workflows
- **Proves_AI** houses the GNN and ML stack (GraphSAGE, reranking, baselines)
