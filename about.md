# About PROVES Kit Agent

## The Vision

Give technical teams a shared memory and a shared way to surface mission-critical risk.

---

## The Solution

Two linked systems:

1) An open source, MCP-backed living documentation library
2) A repo risk assessment extension that checks repos and links to fixes

The system owns outcomes. We log where the fix lives, not who caused the problem.

## How It Works

**The knowledge comes in three shapes:**

- **Build knowledge**: assembly, hardware, flight software, testing
- **Software architecture knowledge**: F Prime architecture, ports, build, GDS
- **Operational knowledge**: configs, tests, issue reports, fixes

**Then it is curated and delivered:**

- Storage: citations and excerpts only, reviewed before inclusion
- Access: MCP server for any AI tool
- Action: IDE risk scan extension for daily checks

## Status

This site documents the concept and research direction. The working implementation will live in a separate repository.
