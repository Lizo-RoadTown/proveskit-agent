# About PROVES Kit Agent

## The Vision

Give university CubeSat teams a shared memory and a shared way to reduce mission risk.

---

## The Problem

Teams lose knowledge when students rotate, and failures are often repeated because lessons are not easy to find or share.

---

## The Solution

Two linked systems:

1) A public, MCP-backed living documentation library
2) A VS Code risk scan extension that checks repos and links to fixes

The system owns outcomes. We log where the fix lives, not who caused the problem.

---

## How It Works

- Sources: PROVES docs, F Prime docs, and public repos
- Storage: citations and excerpts only, reviewed before publication
- Access: MCP server for any AI in VS Code
- Action: risk scan extension for daily checks

---

## Status

This site documents the concept and research direction. The working implementation will live in a separate repository.
