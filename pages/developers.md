# PROVES Kit Agent for Developers

This project is not a code generator. It is a living documentation system plus a repo risk scan.

---

## Quick Start

### 1) Use the Living Library

Search the MCP-backed library for:
- Known issues and fixes
- Risk patterns and how to verify
- Links to source artifacts

[Living Documentation Library](https://lizo-roadtown.github.io/proveskit-agent/living-library/)

### 2) Run the Risk Scan

Use the VS Code extension to scan your repo:

- Pulls risk patterns from the MCP library
- Flags likely mission-critical issues
- Links to fixes and validation steps

---

## Daily Workflow

1) Run the risk scan at the end of each day
2) Review flagged issues and apply fixes
3) Verify with tests or checklists
4) Submit new patterns or lessons for review

---

## Common Use Cases

### Prevent regressions

Find issues before they become mission-critical by checking known risk patterns.

### Onboard new members

Use the library to answer "what did past teams already learn?"

### Share fixes across universities

Submit lessons with citations so other teams do not repeat the same errors.

---

## What This Does Not Do

- It does not generate flight software
- It does not auto-fix code
- It does not log blame or personal fault

The system owns outcomes. The library stores where fixes live.
