# PROVES Kit Agent for Developers

This project provides a living documentation system and a repo risk scan.

---

## Quick Start

### 1) Use the Living Library

Search the MCP-backed library for:
- Known issues and fixes
- Risk patterns and how to verify
- Links to source artifacts

What you will find:
- Build knowledge (assembly, hardware, testing)
- Software architecture knowledge (ports, components, build, GDS)
- Operational knowledge (configs, checklists, fixes)

Why it matters:
- Your repo holds partial answers. The library connects the missing pieces.

### 2) Run the Risk Scan

Use the IDE extension to scan your repo:

- Pulls risk patterns from the MCP library
- Flags likely mission-critical issues
- Links to fixes and validation steps

---

## Daily Workflow

1) Run the risk scan at the end of each day
2) Review flagged issues and apply fixes
3) Verify with tests or checklists
4) Submit new patterns or lessons for review

---

## Common Use Cases

### Prevent regressions

Find issues before they become mission-critical by checking known risk patterns.

### Onboard new members

Use the library to answer "what did past teams already learn?"

### Share fixes across teams

Submit lessons with citations so others avoid repeating the same errors.
