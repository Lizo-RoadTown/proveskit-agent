# PROVES Kit Agent for Researchers

This project studies how an open source, MCP-backed library and a repo risk scan can improve knowledge transfer and mission safety.

It centers on fragmentation as the core failure mode: disconnected issues, code, tests, and documentation across teams and sources.

---

## Research Questions

### 1) Knowledge Transfer

- Does a shared, searchable library reduce repeated failures?
- What types of lessons get reused across teams and projects?
- How does non-attributive logging affect participation?

### 2) Risk Detection

- Which risk patterns are most predictive of mission failure?
- How often do scans catch issues before test or flight?
- What validation steps reduce false positives?

### 3) Incentives and Adoption

- Do contributors participate more when the tool provides daily value?
- Which contribution models work best: opt-in, review-first, or automatic?
- How do teams react to open source sharing?

### 4) Retrieval Quality

- Which indexing strategies best surface the right fixes?
- Do citations and excerpts provide enough context for action?
