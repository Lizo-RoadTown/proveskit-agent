# PROVES Kit Agent for Researchers

This project studies how a public, MCP-backed library and a repo risk scan can improve knowledge transfer and mission safety for university CubeSat teams.

---

## Research Questions

### 1) Knowledge Transfer

- Does a shared, searchable library reduce repeated failures?
- What types of lessons get reused across universities?
- How does no-blame logging affect participation?

### 2) Risk Detection

- Which risk patterns are most predictive of mission failure?
- How often do scans catch issues before test or flight?
- What validation steps reduce false positives?

### 3) Incentives and Adoption

- Do students contribute more when the tool provides daily value?
- Which contribution models work best: opt-in, review-first, or automatic?
- How do teams react to public, cross-university sharing?

### 4) Retrieval Quality

- Which indexing strategies best surface the right fixes?
- Do citations and excerpts provide enough context for action?
