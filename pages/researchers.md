# For Researchers

PROVES Kit Agent is a living testbed for agentic knowledge capture, human verification, and graph-based risk modeling in aerospace systems.

---

## Research Themes

- **Human-in-the-loop curation**: calibrating trust and confidence thresholds
- **ERV relationship semantics**: structured dependency modeling
- **LangGraph orchestration**: multi-agent coordination and state persistence
- **MCP as knowledge interface**: interoperability for AI tooling
- **GNN risk modeling**: cascade prediction from verified graphs

---

## Data and Evaluation

- Curator runs produce structured dependency candidates
- Human review decisions create labeled data for evaluation
- The truth graph provides ground truth for GNN training

---

## Proves_AI (GNN and ML Stack)

The Proves_AI repo contains the GNN scaffold and retrieval stack:

- GraphSAGE for cascade and graph risk
- XGBoost baseline for mission success prediction
- Cross-encoder reranker for retrieval quality
- pgvector embeddings for retrieval experiments
